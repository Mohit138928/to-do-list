# My Todos

This is a To-do list app built on the front-end only where you can add your todo list title and write a brief description on it, and then add it to your list. This will go down in the todo section where you see three buttons: delete, complete, and edit your task. When you complete the todo task and click on the complete button, it will move down into the completed section where you can see your completed todo task, and from there you can also delete it. All tasks are stored in your local storage.

## Description

Completed tasks are moved to a separate section, making it easy to track progress. All tasks are stored in the local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
